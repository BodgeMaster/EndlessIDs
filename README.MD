EndlessIDs is a modern rewrite of NotEnoughIDs which increases the limit even more, up to the maximum 24 bit unsigned integer value.

|           | Vanilla | NotEnoughIDs | EndlessIDs |
|-----------|---------|--------------|------------|
| Block IDs | 4096    | 32000        | 16777216   |
| Item  IDs | 32000   | 32000        | 16777216   |

Mods not listed here may or may not work. A good rule of thumb is that the more invasive a mod is, the higher the chance
it's broken without a patch once the IDs exceed 4096 and 32000.
